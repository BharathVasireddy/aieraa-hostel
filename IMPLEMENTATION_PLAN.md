## Phase 3: React Native Migration (Future)
### When to Consider:
- 1000+ daily active users
- Need for better performance
- Advanced native features required
- Budget for dedicated mobile development

### Benefits:
- Better performance
- Native camera/hardware access
- Better push notifications
- App store presence

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Current (PWA Phase):
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (current)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Payments**: Razorpay
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Supabase (database)
- **Push Notifications**: Web Push API

### Future (React Native Phase):
- **Mobile**: React Native with Expo
- **Backend**: Same Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Same PostgreSQL setup
- **Push**: Firebase Cloud Messaging

## Cost Estimates

### PWA Phase (Monthly):
- **Hosting**: $20-50 (Vercel Pro + Database)
- **Domain**: $10/year
- **Total**: ~$30-60/month

### React Native Phase (Monthly):
- **Development**: $2000-5000 (one-time)
- **App Store Fees**: $99/year (Apple) + $25 (Google)
- **Hosting**: Same as PWA
- **Total**: ~$50-80/month (after development)

## Scalability Plan

### 100 Students: PWA is perfect
### 500 Students: PWA with optimizations
### 1000+ Students: Consider React Native
### 5000+ Students: Dedicated mobile team

## Maintenance Strategy

### You can handle:
- Content updates
- Basic feature additions
- UI modifications
- Database management

### You'll need help with:
- Complex new features
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced integrations
- Mobile app store management

## Risk Mitigation

### Short-term:
- Start with PWA (lower risk, faster deployment)
- Use established technologies
- Keep codebase simple and documented

### Long-term:
- Plan for React Native migration
- Build modular architecture
- Document everything thoroughly
- Consider hiring developers as you scale
